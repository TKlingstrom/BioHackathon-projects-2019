**Project Number:** 27

## Research area alignment

- Interoperability, Data
 Rare Disease, Metabolomics, but relevant for all Communities

## Team

**Submitter:** Denise Slenter

### Proponent(s)

- Denise Slenter

### Lead(s)

- Denise Slenter
- Egon Willighagen ([@egonw](https://github.com/egonw))
- Alasdair Gray

### Nominated participant(s)

- Emma Schymanski - Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine -, Metabolomics and Toxicology expert, and provider of specific use case + data

Nominated but not invited by ELIXIR

- Nick Juty - University of Manchester -, identifiers.org and Compact Identifiers expert
- Tobias Kuhn - Free University of Amsterdam -, nanopublications

## Expected outcomes

- Improve the FAIR metrics of [existing BridgeDb ID mapping databases](https://www.bridgedb.org/mapping-databases/)
- Automation of generation of Scientific Lenses for chemical compounds (see [10.1007/978-3-319-11964-9_7](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-11964-9_7))
- Expand integration of BridgeDb for workflow systems (Galaxy and/or KNIME)
- BridgeDb application to create link sets from [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/) (MolecularEntity) annotation
- Faster identifier mapping (with Apache Derby replacement)
- ID mapping data exchange using nanopublications, allowing explicit provenance being stored

## Expected audience

- ELIXIR Core Resource representations (mapping need and mapping providers)
 Semantic Web and interoperability experts
 Technicians with knowledge of Docker and/or OpenAPI
 Workflow developers (Galaxy, KNIME, CWL)
 Java developers

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
