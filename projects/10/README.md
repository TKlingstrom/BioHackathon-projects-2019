 Evaluation of current strategies of different training communities to support their contributors
 Web service to generate tutorial skeleton from a link to a Galaxy workflow
 Exploration of possibility for the customization of Monod to support Galaxy Training Material templates and generate live website previews
- Direct outcomes of this project include: (a) at least two additional end-to-end Gallantry lessons that will have been evaluated by the involved communities (Galaxy, The Carpentries), (b) interaction and direct involvement of additional relevant communities in the project (such as ELIXIR, GOBLET and H3ABioNet), and (c) evaluation and potential pilot case of scaled up hybrid training within the newly involved networks.
- 1) Discussion with the different ELIXIR communities regarding training needs
 2) Mentoring of interested communities
  - Teaching use of Galaxy Training Materials infrastructure
  - Planning the development of new materials
  - Identifying useful resources for their community
  - Assistance getting started developing new training materials
  - Teaching training best practices
 3) Contributions from underrepresented communities to the GTN
 4) Better training material for ELIXIR Galaxy communities
